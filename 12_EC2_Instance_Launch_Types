1) EC2 instance Launch Types
    a) On Demand instances -- Short workloads, predictable pricing
    b) Reserver (MIMIMUM 1 year)
        i) Reserved Instances : long workloads
        ii) Convertible Reserved Instances : Long workloads with flexible instances ( here we can start with one reserved instance and later
            switch to another one)
        iii) Scheduled Reserved Instances : example -- every Thursday between 3 amd 6 AM 
    c) Spot Instances : short workloads, for cheap, can loose intances(not reliable)
    d) Dedicated Instances : no other customer will share your hardware
    e) Dedicated Hosts : book an entire physical server, control instance placement
2) EC2 On Demand instances
   =======================
    a) Pay for what you use (billing per second after the first minute)
    b) Has the highest cost but no upfront payment, that means you don't have to make any advance payments
    c) No Long term commitment is required in this case.
    d) Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the applications will behave.
    e) So these On demand instances are good for elastic workloads 
3) EC2 Reserved Instances
   ======================
    a) Up to 75% discount compared to On demand instances
    b) Pay upfront for what you use for long term commitment 
    c) Reservation period can be between 1 or 3 years
    d) Recommended for steady state usage application (Ex: Database)
    ==> Convertible Reserved Instances
        ==============================
        a) These are for reservation also except here you can change the EC2 type. So thses will be little expensive but you can have flexibility
            in terms of instances.
        b) gives up 54% of discount compared to On Demand
    ==> Scheduled Reserved Instances
        ============================
        a) Launch within time window you reserved
        b) These are useful when you require a fraction of Day/week/month
4) EC2 Spot Instances
    a) Can get a discount of up to 90% compared to On Demand 
    b) You can loose these instances at any point of time if your max price is less then the current spot price 
    c) These are MOST cost effective instances in AWS
    d) These are useful for workloads that are resilient to failure
        for example:
            i) Batch jobs
            ii) Data Analysis
            iii) Image processing
            etc 
    e) These are not great for critical jobs or Databases
5) So the Great Combo would be:
    To have Reserved instances for baseline (for example an app require 10 instances all the time) + On Demand instances or Spot instance for Peaks
6) EC2 Dedicated Hosts
   ===================
    a) Physical dedicated EC2 server for your use
    b) Full control of EC2 instance placement
    c) you get visibility into underlying sockets/physical cores of the hardware. which are useful for licensing purposes
    d) Allocated for your account for a 3 years period reservation in advance and you need to have underlying sockets and cores access.
    e) More expensive
    f) Useful for softwares that have complicated license model (Bring your own license -- BYOL)
    g) Or useful for companies that have strong regulatory or compliance needs
7) EC2 Dedicated instances 
   =======================
    a) Instances running on hardware that's dedicated to you
    b) They may share hardware with orhter incstances but only in the same AWS account
    c) No control over instance placement(can only change hardware dedicated instance running on, by only stoping / starting)
    d) The difference between the charecterstics of Dedicated instances and Dedicated hosts can be seen from the below mentioned Image
        12.1_EC2_Dedicated_instance_vs_EC2_Dedicated_hosts.png
8) So to understand all these instances better lets have a look at example in the below image related to hotel room reservation
        12.2_hostel_example_for_types_of_EC2_instances.png
9) We can have a look at the pricing for these instances using below table
