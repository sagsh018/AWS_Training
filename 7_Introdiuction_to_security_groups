1) Security groups are fundamental of network security in aws
2) They control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 machine. basically manages the inbound and outbound traffic.
3) It is a most fundamental skill to learn to troubleshoot networking issue
4) In this lecture we are going to learn how to use them to allow, inbound, and outbound ports.
5) So lets check out few things related to security groups in AWS console.
    => EC2 => EC2 Dashboard => running Instance => click on running instance => See below description section => check out the "security groups"
    option => click on inbound rules/outbound rules to see the current firewall rules => click on security group name => security group page =>
    (We could also reach to security group page from left hand side headings on EC2 instance page) => select the security group => see below
    description section => inbound => outbound => tags section.
6) Inbound rules decide what and how traffic comes inside the EC2 instance
7) Outbound rules define how and what all traffic is going to leave from EC2 instance.
8) Click on Inbound Tab => Click on edit => remove the ssh on port 22 rule we have added while creating the security group and after that we
    won't be able to login to EC2 instance using ssh on port 22. => Add back the removed rule for ssh => Click on Add rule on inbound rule edit
    page => select type(SSH) => protocol(TCP) => Port(22) => Source(Custom) => give IP : 0.0.0.0/0 => Description => Click on save => This created
    same rule again we have deleted before and now you can again login to EC2 instance.
9) Click on outbound tab => Shows all traffic can leave from this EC2 and can communicate with any out machine. And this is fine
10) So security groups act as  a firewall on EC2  instances.
11) They regulate:
    a) Access to ports
    b) Authorize the IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
    c) Control inbound network(from other to this instance)
    d) control outbound network(from this instance to other)
    e) and if we see on security group page in console we can see all the inbound or outbound rules in a nice table
12) Security groups are really firewall outside of your EC2 instances
13) Single security group can be attached to multiple instances and one EC2 instance can have multiple security groups as well
14) Security groups are locked down to regions/VPC combination and if you change the region you won't see the same security group there.
15) Security group live outside the EC2 instance and if the traffic is blocked by security group than EC2 instance will not see it.
16) It's always good to maintain one separate security group for SSH 
17) If the application is not accessible (time out error) then its a security group issue
18) if the application gives  a "connection Refused" error then its an application error or its not launched correctly.
19) All inbound traffic is blocked by default
20) all outbound traffic is Authorized by default.
21) Now we will check out how to reference security group from other security group:
    a) Suppose we have an EC2 instance and it is part of security group let say named as "security group 1" 
    b) The inbound rules for that security group let say are :
        i) Authorising security group 1
        ii) Authorising security group 2
        So why did we do this:
    c) Suppose there is another EC2 instance and it is part of security group 2, so since we have authorized security group 2 in the inbound 
        rules of security group 1, this EC2 instance which is part of security group 2 can directly go and talk to EC2 instance which is part of
        security group 1 on the port we will decide them to talk.
    d) Also let say we have another EC2 instance which is also part of security group 1, and since we have also authorised security group 1 in
        the inbound rules of security group 1, so even this EC2 instance will be able to talk to other EC2 instance in the SG1 on the decided
        port
    e) and suppose there is another EC2 instance that is part of security group named "security group 3" and since this is not authorised in the
        inbound rules of security group 1, any EC2 instance part of this SG will not be allowed to talk to EC2 instance of SG1
