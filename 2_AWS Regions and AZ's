AWS REGIONS
============
1) AWS has regions all around the world.
2) AWS regions can be seen in AWS console from :: AWS console main page >> Right hand upper corner >> drop down >> you will see the list of region names along with there
  codes. for example: us-east-1, eu-west-3, etc
3) A region is nothing but cluster of data centers.
4) Most AWS services are region scoped. by this it means that, suppose if you use a service in one region and than you tried using the same service in another region, than 
  you won't have your data replicated from previous region.

AWS Availability Zones
=======================
1) Each AWS region has many availability zones. Usually there are 3 AZ's, Minimum of 2 AZ's and Maximum of 6 AZ's
  Example:
  ========
  a) ap-southeast-2a
  b) ap-southeast-2b
  c) ap-southeast-2c
2) Each Availability zone (AZ) is one or more descrete data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity
3) These AZ's in one region are separated from each other, so that they are isolated from disasters.
4) These AZ's in one region are connected with high bandwidth and ultra low latency networking.


To select the perticular region, we can do :: AWS console main page >> Right hand upper corner >> drop down >> From the drop down select whatever region you want.

Note that there are two types of services:
  a) region specific :: they are different in different regions, examples-- EC2
  b) Global services :: They are at global level and not specific to any region. example-- IAM
