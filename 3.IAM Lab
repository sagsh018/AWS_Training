1) Make sure you choose region as US East(N. virginia). This is most up to date region.
    but one thing to note here is that under IAM the region will be Global. That means, whichever user, group, roles
    are created they are at global level and not specific to any perticular region.
2) You can find IAM service under "Security, Identity and compliance" section of AWS console.
3) Now once you are at the IAM page you can see following things
    a) IAM user sign-in link
        https://592590975420.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
        So this is a link which you can sent to your users. This is made up of you account number followed by signin.aws.
        amazon.com/console. To think link is a public accessible URL for your users to this AWS account.
        you can customise this URL from the customize link on the right had side of URL. So lets modify it to
        https://sagsh018.signin.aws.amazon.com/console
    b) IAM resources
        Shows number users, groups, roles, identity providers, customer managed policies.
    c) security status of account.
        This contain five tasks which measured the security status of your account.
        So lets fix them one by one
        i) Delete your root access keys
            When we try to create the access keys for root user account, we create access key ID and secret access key  
            as a pair, which is visible and available for download only once. as soon as you leave the page of keys 
            creation the pair of access key and Key ID are deleted. Hence this measure os already passed.
        ii) Acitivte multi-factor authentication of root account (MFA)
            Note that root account credentials are the email address and the password you have used to create and login
            for the first time in AWS console.
            Now in order to enable MFA on root account click on Manage MFA. This will land you to security cred page
            click on activate MFS option and then choose virtual MFA device out of the option from types of MFA you
            want. 
            click continue and click on show QR code and i have scan it using VIP access. once you scan the QR code 
            it will ger registered with the VIP application and then you can provide the secret code two times from VIP 
            app to complete the process of enabling MFA
            once donw this will show you have successfully assigned MFA to your AWS account root account.
        iii) Create Individual IAM user
            Click on Manage User==> Then click on Add user==> Then enter your user name (dslssha) in my case
            and also select what access you want like programatic and AWS console level access. 
            We will click on both 
            Programmatic access -- This is used when we try to access AWS resources using AWS Cli, like connecting 
            to AWS EC2 instance using AWS cli.
            AWS console acccess -- Its direct access to AWS console from Web
            So after choosing both types of access,
            select auto generated password and check the box for pasword reset for next time login.

            Then click on next and it will then ask to add user into the group. for that we will create our group
            with name developer. so on that page click on create group. give the group name as developers.
            Then we can choose the policy from the list. We will choose administratoraccess policy.

            Note that there are many other policies with different job functions like Databaseadministrator, billing, etc
            Also note that policies with AWS sign in fonr of them are AWS managed policies and these are written in JSON.

            So once we selected the policy click on create group. Then we will back to user add page where we will add
            our user to developer group and click next to add the tag. Then click on review. and then from there create 
            user.
            Then we will land on the page that will have our user name and the password and access keys and keys ID.
            We can download that info in a form of CSV file and store it in the same folder   
            /c/Users/Sagar/projects/AWS_Training/new_user_credentials.csv
            once the file is downloaded close the page and we will be back to the dashboard.

            Note that the policy we have applied to the developers group is Administratoraccess and contains following 
            JSON code
            {
                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                "Statement": [
                    {
                        "Effect": "Allow",
                        "Action": "*",
                        "Resource": "*"
                    }
                ]
            }
            So this provide effect as allow any action on any resource.
        iv)IAM password policy
            click on manage password policy==> set password policy
            Then on the very next page and select whatever you want to apply to your user account password 
            like minimum length, atleast one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one special character, etc.
            once done click on apply and go back to your dashboard and you will see you have achieved all five security
            contraints and your security status is 100%
4) Now if you will notice on IAM resource section you will find link to number of users, click on that and then click on
    perticlur user and that will take you to all the information related to that user like permissions to that user,
    groups it is part of, security credentials- where you can see the user name, password, access key and access key ID
    and also modify them based on your needs.

5) Then finally we are going to study about the Roles.
    Roles are used to allow one aws server to go and use another aws service. for example we can allow our EC2 instance
    to talk to S3
    So we can also say that IAM is a secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust. The entities may include:
        a) IAM user in another account
        b) App code running on EC2 instance that need to perform action on AWS resource.
        c) AWS service that need to act on resources in your account to provide its feature
        d) users from corporate directory who uses identity federation with SAML.
    So lets create a role by clocking on Roles in the left pane on IAM dashboard, and then on that page click create
    role.
    On the page we will choose the entity tyoe to which we want to provide access to. in our case we are choosing AWS 
    service. Then we aer going to choose the user case/AWS service to which we want to assignt this role to.
    We will choose EC2. and then click on Next:permissions, on the permissions page we are going to choose the policy to 
    assign permissions to this role. and we have choose Amazons3fullaccess policy. So with this our EC2 will have full 
    to S3 service.
    Then after choosing the policy click on next, give the keya dn tag pair and then again click next. on this page give 
    the name to this role : S3_admin_access. Also this page will have description about this role. So thats it click
    on create role. and this will crete a role.

    Exam Tips
    =========
    1) IAM is universal. It does not apply to any region at this time.
    2) root account is a account which is setup when first setup your AWS account. it has complete AWS account access.
    3) New user when crated have no permissions and we have to explicitly assign them policies to give them access.
    4) New users are assinged Access Key ID and secret Access key when they are first created and opted for Programmatic
        access
    5) Access key ID and secret access key are not same as that of the password. you cannot make use of them to login to
        console. you can only use them to access AWS via API and CLI.
    6) you only get to view your access key ID and secret access key once, hence save them in proper place.
    7) Always setup MFA on root account
    8) you can create and customize your own password rotation policies.
