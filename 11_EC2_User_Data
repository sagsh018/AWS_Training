1) It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User Data script
2) bootstrapping means launching commands when the machine starts
3) This user data script is only run first at the instance first run
4) EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as :
    a) Installing updates
    b) insalling softwares
    c) Downloading common files from internet
    d) Anything you think of
5) The EC2 user data scripts run on machine with root user, so whatever command you will enter in user data script will run with root privileges
    on machine.
6) So let's go ahead and do a hands on for User Data Scripts. We will Do following tasks at the boot time of EC2 instance
    a) We will update the EC2 instance for all the softwares
    b) Install Apache httpd 
    c) Then display simple web page in browser- so for that we will put simple index.html file in root of apache server
7) So refer the script written for that : 11.1_user_data_script.sh 
8) So first we will terminate the EC2 instance currently running as of Now, so that we can start a new one with user data script. 
    EC2 instance page ==> select the EC2 instance ==> right click ==> click on Terminate instance
9) Now lets launch new instance:
    EC2 service ==> EC2 Dashboard ==> Click on launch new instance ==> Select Amazon linux 2 AMI ==> select instance type as t2.micro and click
    on next ==> Configure instance page ==> Leave all the configuration as it is and go at the end of page ==> Advance details ==> user data
    box ==> Select as text ==> enter steps in the box as mentioned in the "11.1_user_data_script.sh" ==> click on next ==> leave the storage to
    default ==> click on next ==> Add Tag ==> click on next ==> configure security group ==> select existing security group ==> 
    "my-first-security-group" ( it has port 22 and 80 both opened already) ==> click on Review and Launch ==> click on Launch ==> choose existing
    key pair ==> click on launch instances
10) Now go back to EC2 instance page and you will see the new EC2 instance up and running ==> take its public IP and try to hit apache from 
    web browser ==> It shows our index.html web page.
11) We can also login to the newly launched instance and see the index.html updated with message we want.
