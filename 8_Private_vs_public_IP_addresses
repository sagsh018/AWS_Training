1) Networking has two types of IP's
    a) IPv4
    b) IPv6
2) In this course for AWS we are only going to work with IPv4 IP addresses
3) IPv6 is mostly used in case of IoT
4) IPv4 allows 3.7 Billions different addresses in the public space.
5) IPv4 : [0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255]
6) Difference between public and provate IP's 
    Public IP
    ==========
    a) Public IP means the machine can be identified over internet(WWW)
    b) Public IP must be unique across the whole web (not two machines can have the same public IP)
    c) Can be geo located easily

    Private IP
    ===========
    a) Private IP means that the machine can only be identified in the private Network
    b) The IP must be unique only across the private Network
    c) But two differnet priviate networks (Two companies) can have the same IP's 
    d) Machines can connect to outside internet (www) using NAT + internet Gateway(proxy)
    e) Only specified range of IP's can be used as private IP
    Refer to diagram :: 8.1_Difference_between_public_and_private_IP.png
7) Elastic IP's 
    a) As we know when we stop and start the EC2 instance, it can change its public IP
    b) So if you want to have fixed IP address, they you have to look out of elastic IP
    c) Elastic IP is basically a public IPv4 IP that you own, as long as you don't delete it.
    d) You can attach it to only one instance at a time 
    e) One advantage with Elastic IP is that you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another 
        instance in your account
    f) You can have only 5 Elastic IP's in your AWS account, and if you want more you will have to ask AWS to increase it.
    g) Overall, try to avoid using Elastic IP address, because:
        i) They often reflect poor architectural decision
        ii) Instead use random IP address and register a DNS name to it
        iii) Or use Load balancers and don't use public IP at all.
8) So when it comes to our AWS architecture
    a) By default, our EC2 instance comes with :
        i) A private IP for internal AWS network
        ii) A public IP for WWWW
    b) When we are doing SSH into our EC2 instances :
        i) We can't use private IP address, as we are not on the same network as that of AWS, untill you have VPN in place.
        ii) We can use only the public IP to ssh to EC2 instance
    c) And as we have discussed before, if your machine stopped and start, the public IP changes.
