1) Availability Zone (AZ) - it is just a data center. An AZ may have several Data centers, but because they are close to 
                            each other so they can be counted as 1 AZ. 
                            So 1 AZ could be 1 or more Data Centers which could be couple of miles away let say.
2) Region - A region is a geographical area. Each region consist of 2 (or more) AZ.
3) Edge Location - These are end points for AWS which are used for caching content. Typically this consist of cloudfront
                    which nothing but Amazon's Content Delivery Network(CDN)
                    There are many more edge locations than Regions.
